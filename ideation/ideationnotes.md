### Source an idea ###

- What is it? What problem am I solving? 🤍
- Define app, what it will do, who it is for, why it's being create... and why would someone use it?

How much time do I have to build this app?

        So much time.

What am I interesting in?

        Everything. But this is about organization.

What apps do I enjoy using?

        - Task management apps w/ easy to navigate queues, filters, data visualization
        
        - Can't get Cherwell out of my mind

What do I like about these apps?

        Clean, intuitive design, enough granularity to make it functional for different types of needs

How much time/money will this app save or generate for me as a user?

        It's a passion project; I want a personal task management system, so I'm building one.

How much will it improve my life?

        I need to figure out how to measure this! 🌜⭐

### Market research ###

        I don't want to.

        Does a similar product exist?

        🌷 Definitely, but this is going to be a great learning experience even if it's not a marketable app. But it will be.

        Does a market for this exist?

        🌷 Yes, and it always will for task management and asset management and knowledge management
        I am the market.

        My app's target market:

        🌷 Budding Overachievers and Seasoned Procrastinators alike
        🌷 People who like checklists
        🌷 People who like visualizing their daily, weekly, and so on goals
        🌷 People who have sent their spouses or children the same task list five hundred times
        🌷 People who need to record and organize their priorities
        🌷 People looking to maintain and visualize data on their personal productivity
        🌷 People who want a faster way to attach documents and assets to their related functionality/usage
        🌷 People who freak out when there's way too much paper clutter

### Define functionality ###
