// How Do I Make An App? Seriously.

// IDEATION üåº
// Source an idea (yeah)

// What is it?
// Define app, what it will do, who it is for, why am I making it? why would someone use it?
// What problem am I solving? ü§ç

// Research? (admittedly, I skipped this)
// Functionality (how deeply)

// How much time do I have to build this app?
// So much time.

// What am I interesting in?
// Everything. But this is about organization.

// What apps do I enjoy using?
// Not Amazon Prime Video
// Can't get Cherwell out of my mind

// What do I like about these apps?
// Clean, intuitive design, enough granularity to make it functional for different types of needs

// How much time/money will this app save or generate for me as a user?
// It's a passion project; I want a personal task management system so I'm building one.

// How much will it improve my life?
// I need to figure out how to measure this one!

// DESIGN üåº
// Sketch, first prototype ‚úÖ
// Plan workflow (doing that now)
// Wireframe the UI (ha, hahaha)
// Seek early validation (that's what friends are for)

// DEVELOPMENT üåº
// Architect DB (will hardcode most things in first stages)
// Develop Front End
// Build Back End

// LAUNCH üåº
// Host web app
// Deploy web app

// When test? How test?


// Disorganized Thoughts
// What tech am I going to use?
// Vanilla Stack: HTML, CSS, JS + Node and probably SQL backend but nottt quite sure yet
// Will need to figure out Auth's - Authentication and Authorization
// Will I need a CMS?
// Classes / OOP for the Templates and Tasks
// Open tasks could be overwhelming - mass "halt" option w/ note from queue view
// Calendar integrations
